    <h1>Google Engine</h1>
    <p>Google Search (also known simply as Google), is a search engine provided by Google. Handling more than 3.5
        billion searches per day,[3] it has a 92% share of the global search engine market.[4] It is also the
        most-visited website in the world.[5]

        The order of search results returned by Google is based, in part, on a priority rank system called "PageRank".
        Google Search also provides many different options for customized searches, using symbols to include, exclude,
        specify or require certain search behavior, and offers specialized interactive experiences, such as flight
        status and package tracking, weather forecasts, currency, unit, and time conversions, word definitions, and
        more.

        The main purpose of Google Search is to search for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers,
        as opposed to other data, such as images or data contained in databases. It was originally developed in 1997 by
        Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Scott Hassan.[6][7][8] In June 2011, Google introduced "Google Voice Search" to
        search for spoken, rather than typed, words.[9] In May 2012, Google introduced a Knowledge Graph semantic search
        feature in the U.S.

        Analysis of the frequency of search terms may indicate economic, social and health trends.[10] Data about the
        frequency of use of search terms on Google can be openly inquired via Google Trends and have been shown to
        correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels, and provide the information faster than traditional
        reporting methods and surveys. As of mid-2016, Google's search engine has begun to rely on deep neural networks
