    <h1>Ecommerce</h1>
    <p>E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the activity of electronically buying or selling of products on online
        services or over the Internet. E-commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds
        transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data
        interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems. E-commerce is in turn
        driven by the technological advances of the semiconductor industry, and is the largest sector of the electronics
        industry.

        E-commerce typically uses the web for at least a part of a transaction's life cycle although it may also use
        other technologies such as e-mail. Typical e-commerce transactions include the purchase of products (such as
        books from Amazon) or services (such as music downloads in the form of digital distribution such as iTunes
        Store).[1] There are three areas of e-commerce: online retailing, electronic markets, and online auctions.
        E-commerce is supported by electronic business.</p>
